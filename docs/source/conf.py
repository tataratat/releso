    A little complication, is that if a `autodoc-skip-member` event is
    registered if the `napoleon` extension is enabled, it will be called
    instead of the default skip member function. (It is not additive)
    So I am calling this function from this new skip function so that I do
    not have to reimplement the same functionality.

    Additional members that are skipped are pydantic functions that are
    inherited and functions that start with `check_` or `validate_`. These
    functions are used as validators for the data in this package and should
    normally not be called from user code.

        would_skip (bool): Decision of the object should be skipped from
            previous checks.
